{{./pasted_image002.png}}

This is the default Task Manager for the Plasma Desktop. It works very similar to the Task Bar on Windows, allowing for files and programs to be pinned to it. Clicking an icon launches that program, and clicking a launched program toggles between minimised and visible.

Hovering over an open program allows for a preview dialog to show, displaying a mini version of the window, and the option to close it.

Multiple windows of the same program will be shown, when the icon is hovered, as such.

New programs can be pinned to the Task Manager as such: Right Click > Pin to Task Manager > (On All Activities, if shown)

=== System Tray ===

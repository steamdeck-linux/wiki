====== Contributor's Guide ======

This wiki will be designed in a Zim desktop wiki, until such time that a better alternative is found (maybe a mediawiki can be configured).

For now, guides should be in a fairly simple format. Topical headings, then images with descriptive captions.
[[https://flameshot.org/|Flameshot]] is really useful for making good screenshots.

Zim automatically adds a heading when making a new page. It also adds a created on date stamp, which isn't needed and should be removed.
Headings can be set with keyboard shortcuts "Ctrl + 1 through 5".

Page headings are Ctrl + 1, or Heading 1 in the Format menu.
Sub headings are Ctrl + 4, or Heading 4.

You can preview the Wiki in your browser, by going to Tools > Start Web Server.
I would advise picking the template "ZeroFiveEight".
